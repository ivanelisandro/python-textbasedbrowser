# Stage 5:

Requirements:

- This stage must process the content of a page as text, instead of showing the whole HTML;

- Only a subset of all possible tags will be considered for content;

- These are the tags that should be shown: `<p>`, `headers`, `<a>`, `ul`, `ol` and `li`;

- We should use the `beautifulsoup4` library to handle the extraction of the content;

- Previous behaviour continues the same;
