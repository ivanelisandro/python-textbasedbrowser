# Python project: Text-Based Browser

This is one of the projects provided by JetBrains Academy, a platform for studying programming languages.
I particularly used it to start learning python while using the PyCharm IDE for their great integration with the service.

I am starting the project now, so I cannot give an accurate description of what it does at the moment.
